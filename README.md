#### GitHub Contributions are a Bad Measure of productivity

Reasons:

 - private repositories
 - separate acounts
 - other professional responsibilities
 - other personal responsibilities (e.g., childcare, family holidays)
 - contributions vary in time commiment
 - contributions vary in priority and importance (e.g, urgent patches, current active projects, maintaining older projects, voluntary open-source participation)
 - they can be modified with meaningless nonsense and backdated retrospectively (e.g., THIS REPOSITORY)
